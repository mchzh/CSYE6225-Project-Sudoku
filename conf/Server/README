Install apache and php:
1. sudo apt-get update
2. sudo apt-get install apache2
3. sudo apt-get install php5
4. sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mcrypt

Connect to file system:
1. sudo apt-get install nfs-common
2. cd /var/www/html
3. sudo mkdir -p sudoku
4. sudo mount -t nfs 54.201.110.215:/sudoku ./sudoku

Upload file:
In sudoku.php file, once I've got a new sudoku result, I'll use fopen() function to create new ".txt" file into the "sudoku" folder and use the content of this sudoku as the file name to avoid duplicate.
Since "sudoku" folder is mounted to the file server, that file will be directly uploaded to file server. Then I use fwrite() function to store the sudoku result into that file. In this way, the sudoku answer is successfully saved in the file system.
